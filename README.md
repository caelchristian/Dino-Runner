# Module 4 Large Project (Cael Christian and Quimby Warden)

## Required Libraries: SFML 2.5.x

## Install the libraries (for Windows) [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/).
### Note: You should be careful to install the 32/64 bit versions according to your machine.
### Windows version may require external libraries. Refer to them here: [here](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Installing-SFML-dependencies).

## Installing sfml with Brew (MacOS)
```brew install sfml```

## Compiling sfml.cpp
### cmake_install should include all SFML libraries if they are installed on your system correctly. Use CLion to compile the program.
#### If you're having trouble the [compiling with cmake](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php) documentation may help.

## Run the dino executable inside cmake-build-debug
####(project root dir)/make-build-debug/dino

### If the compiler cannot find <SFML/Graphics.hpp> you may need to add SFML libraries manually. Refer to the SFML documentation above.

## Grade: 100
#### All requirements were met, as well as use of a different API than the starter code that was provided was a great challenge.
